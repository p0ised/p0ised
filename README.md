- ⚡ Fun fact:  We can "weigh" black holes, even though they haven't been directly observed, by analyzing the motions of stars and gas swirling around them using sophisticated data science techniques like machine learning and gravitational wave analysis! This allows us to understand the mass and properties of these mysterious giants, despite never having actually "seen" them directly.✨

Education:

Master Graduate Certificate in Data Science (The University of Texas at San Antonio)
Master's in Business Administration (The University of Texas at San Antonio)
